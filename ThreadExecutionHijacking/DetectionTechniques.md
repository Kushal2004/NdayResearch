# Detection Techniques for Thread Execution Hijacking

Detecting thread execution hijacking involves monitoring specific data sources and identifying suspicious behaviors indicative of process injection. Here are the key detection strategies:

## Data Sources and Components for Detection

### Process: OS API Execution

**Data Source**: Operating System (OS) API execution logs.  
**Data Component**: API calls.  
**Detection**:

- **API Monitoring**: Monitor specific Windows API calls that are indicative of process injection, such as:
  - `CreateRemoteThread`
  - `SuspendThread`
  - `SetThreadContext`
  - `ResumeThread`
  - `VirtualAllocEx`
  - `WriteProcessMemory`
- **Challenges**: These API calls can generate significant data and may also be used legitimately, making it difficult to distinguish between benign and malicious usage. Therefore, it is crucial to collect data under specific circumstances and focus on known bad sequences of calls.
- **Approach**:
  - Implement rules to detect sequences of API calls that typically indicate thread execution hijacking. For example, a sequence of `SuspendThread`, `VirtualAllocEx`, `WriteProcessMemory`, `SetThreadContext`, and `ResumeThread` in quick succession.
  - Use machine learning models to analyze patterns and detect anomalies in API call usage.
  - Correlate API call data with other indicators, such as unusual process behavior or the presence of known malware signatures.

### Process Access

**Data Source**: Process monitoring logs.  
**Data Component**: Process access events.  
**Detection**:

- **Process Viewing**: Monitor for processes that are being viewed or accessed in ways that might suggest an attempt to inject code. This includes:
  - Unusual access patterns, such as frequent opening and reading of process memory.
  - Access by processes that do not typically interact with the targeted process.
- **Indicators**:
  - Processes accessing the memory of high-value or commonly targeted processes (e.g., `svchost.exe`, `explorer.exe`).
  - Access by processes with lower privileges to processes with higher privileges.

### Process Modification

**Data Source**: Process monitoring logs.  
**Data Component**: Process modification events.  
**Detection**:

- **Modification Events**: Monitor for changes to process memory or execution state that indicate potential code injection. This includes:
  - Memory allocation within another process (e.g., using `VirtualAllocEx`).
  - Writing to the memory of another process (e.g., using `WriteProcessMemory`).
  - Changing the execution context of a thread within another process (e.g., using `SetThreadContext`).
- **Indicators**:
  - Rapid sequence of memory allocation, writing, and context setting within a short time frame.
  - Modification attempts on processes that are typically protected or have elevated privileges.

## Practical Implementation

### Monitoring with Sysmon

Microsoft Sysmon (System Monitor) can be configured to capture detailed information on process creation, network connections, and changes to file creation time. It can be particularly useful for monitoring API calls and process modifications indicative of thread execution hijacking.


# Mitigations for Thread Execution Hijacking

Mitigating thread execution hijacking involves implementing various security measures to detect and block malicious behaviors that indicate process injection. Below is a detailed description of these mitigations:

## M1040: Behavior Prevention on Endpoint

**Mitigation ID**: M1040  
**Mitigation**: Behavior Prevention on Endpoint  
**Description**: Some endpoint security solutions can be configured to block some types of process injection based on common sequences of behavior that occur during the injection process. 

### Detailed Description

### Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Solutions

- **Behavior Analysis**: EDR solutions can monitor for suspicious behavior patterns associated with thread execution hijacking. This includes detecting sequences of API calls and process actions that are indicative of this technique.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Using machine learning algorithms, EDR solutions can analyze normal process behavior and detect anomalies that may indicate malicious activity.
- **Real-time Alerts**: When suspicious behavior is detected, EDR solutions can generate real-time alerts to notify security teams for immediate investigation and response.

### Process Execution Policies

- **Policy Enforcement**: Configure endpoint security policies to enforce strict rules around process execution. For example, prevent processes from performing operations like `SuspendThread`, `VirtualAllocEx`, `WriteProcessMemory`, `SetThreadContext`, and `ResumeThread` unless explicitly allowed.
- **Whitelisting**: Implement process whitelisting to ensure only trusted processes are allowed to perform potentially dangerous actions. Any unapproved process attempting to execute these actions can be blocked and flagged for review.

### Memory Protection

- **Memory Integrity Checks**: Utilize security solutions that perform integrity checks on process memory to detect unauthorized modifications. This can help identify and block attempts to inject code into running processes.
- **Executable Space Protection**: Implement technologies such as Data Execution Prevention (DEP) and Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) to protect against memory-based attacks. These measures make it more difficult for attackers to execute injected code.

### User and Process Privileges

- **Least Privilege Principle**: Enforce the principle of least privilege for both users and processes. By limiting the privileges of processes and users, the impact of a successful thread execution hijacking attempt can be minimized.
- **Privileged Access Management**: Implement solutions to manage and monitor privileged access. This includes tracking the use of privileged accounts and detecting any unusual or unauthorized activity.

### Continuous Monitoring and Incident Response

- **Continuous Monitoring**: Deploy continuous monitoring solutions to keep an eye on system behavior and detect any signs of process injection. This includes monitoring process creation, memory allocation, and API call patterns.
- **Incident Response Plan**: Develop and maintain an incident response plan to handle detected threats effectively. This should include procedures for isolating affected systems, analyzing malicious activity, and remediating the threat.

### Endpoint Security Configuration

- **Security Baselines**: Establish and enforce security baselines for endpoint configurations to ensure that all systems have appropriate security settings. This includes configuring security software to detect and block suspicious behavior.
- **Regular Updates**: Keep endpoint security solutions and operating systems updated with the latest patches and signatures to protect against known vulnerabilities and malware variants.

By implementing these mitigations, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of thread execution hijacking and enhance their overall security posture against advanced process injection techniques.
