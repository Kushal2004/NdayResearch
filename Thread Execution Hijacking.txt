Process Injection: Thread Execution Hijacking

Process Injection is a sophisticated technique employed by adversaries to inject malicious code into the address space 
of another process, allowing them to evade detection and elevate privileges. One of the sub-techniques of process injection 
is Thread Execution Hijacking, which involves injecting code into an existing live process. This method is particularly 
insidious as it hijacks an active thread within the target process, masking the malicious activity under the guise of 
legitimate operations.
